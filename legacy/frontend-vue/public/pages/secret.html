              you matter deeply to someone in this world.</p

            <p
              >I want you to know that your worth isn't measured by your past or defined by the struggles you've faced.
              You are inherently valuable, deserving of love, kindness, and all the beautiful things life has to
              offer.</p

              of them. They do not make you a lesser person. All the beautiful and loved things, were never meant to be
              ideal. Over time, I knew you were beautiful inside and out, and were gonna be
              <strong>perfect for me</strong>.</p

            <p

              change is possible and that you deserve the good in the world. To <em>accept your past</em>, and
              <em>keep faith</em> that things could change for the better. And most of all, I want to give you the hope
              and safety to be vulnerable enough to make these changes, with me by your side.</p

              are dreams you've set aside, perhaps we can find a way to nurture them back to life. If there are parts of
              yourself you've hidden away, know that they're welcome here, in this space I'm creating for you.</p
